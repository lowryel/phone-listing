| **Prometheus & Grafana**    | Non-Functional (Performance Monitoring) | Prometheus for real-time monitoring and Grafana for visualizing performance metrics.                                 | Can be used to collect and visualize system performance data while running Playwright performance tests.                  |
| **WebPageTest**             | Non-Functional (Performance)    | A performance testing tool that analyzes page load times and identifies bottlenecks.                                 | Can be triggered by Playwright scripts to evaluate how well the website performs under different conditions.              |
| **JMeter**                  | Non-Functional (Load Testing)   | A tool for testing performance under different loads, particularly useful for load and stress testing web apps.      | Can be used alongside Playwright to simulate high user traffic and test web app performance.                              |
| **Pa11y**                   | Non-Functional (Accessibility)  | An accessibility testing tool that checks web applications for compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG).       | Can be integrated with Playwright to run accessibility tests across different pages or components.                        |
| **Snyk**                    | Non-Functional (Security)       | A security testing tool that scans your code and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.                            | Can be used in conjunction with Playwright for ensuring that the application is free from security vulnerabilities.        |
| **OWASP ZAP**               | Non-Functional (Security)       | An open-source security testing tool for identifying vulnerabilities and performing penetration tests.               | Playwright scripts can trigger OWASP ZAP scans to test web application security.                                          |
| **k6**                      | Non-Functional (Load Testing)   | A tool for load testing that allows writing performance tests as code.                                              | Playwright tests can be paired with k6 for simulating traffic and testing performance at scale.                           |

| **Cypress**                 | Functional (End-to-End Testing) | A testing framework for end-to-end testing of web applications with automatic waiting and browser control.           | While Cypress is a competitor to Playwright, both can be used together in larger projects for specific purposes.           |
| **Axe Core**                | Non-Functional (Accessibility)  | An accessibility testing engine that checks for WCAG compliance.                                                     | Can be integrated with Playwright to run automated accessibility checks during the test cycle.                            |

### **Key Points**

* **Functional Tools**: Jest, Mocha, Chai, Cucumber.js, Postman, and BrowserStack help test user interactions, features, and APIs to ensure they work as expected.
* **Non-Functional Tools**: Lighthouse, JMeter, Prometheus & Grafana, OWASP ZAP, and Snyk focus on testing for performance, security, load handling, and accessibility.
* **Hybrid Tools**: Allure Report can be used for generating reports from both functional and non-functional testing.

This diverse range of tools can be integrated with Playwright to support different testing scenarios for comprehensive coverage.
